# Feast-or-Famine

Feast or Famine is a twist on the classic tower defense game written in C++ using the ECS library EnTT. Monsters use species-specific pathfinding to find their way to your village, and survival becomes increasingly difficult throughout the changing seasons.

Enemies steal you food upon reaching the village, and running out of food will cause you to lose!
